			<h2>UC Davis Data & Analytics - Final Project</h2>
			<p>Most Americans are well aware that half of marriages end in divorce. The good news is that divorce rate in the
				US is decreasing, however, so is the marriage rate. According to the Center for Disease Control, the 2018
				marriage rate was 6.9 per 1,000 total population while the divorce rate was 2.9 per 1,000 population. Both rates
				were decreased by a tenth of a point from the previous year and the year before. It seems fewer couples are
				willing to gamble the risk these days and opt out of marriage. With the high risk of divorce, we found the
				subject of divorce to be a compelling machine learning exercise. Can divorce be predicted based on specific
				attributes? </p>

							<p>Most Americans are well aware that half of marriages end in divorce. The good news is that divorce rate
								in the US is decreasing, however, so is the marriage rate. According to the Center for Disease Control,
								the 2018 marriage rate was 6.9 per 1,000 total population while the divorce rate was 2.9 per 1,000

								risk of divorce, we found the subject of divorce to be a compelling machine learning exercise. Can
								divorce be predicted based on specific attributes? </p>
							<p>When looking for datasets around divorce we came across a study done in Turkey, where divorce rates
								have been increasing and are among the highest of the 33 member countries of the Organization for
								Economic Cooperation and Development (<a target="_blank"
									href="https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/748448">Yontem et al</a>). The study used
								aspects of the Gottman couples therapy model, a model that derives the cause of divorce using empirical
								research (for more information on the Gottman Method <a target="_blank"
									href="https://www.gottman.com/about/the-gottman-method/">click here</a>). The study developed a
								Divorce Predictor Scale (DPS) based on the Gottman model. The DPS was composed of 54 questions exploring
								the interactions and feelings between couples. The study surveyed both married and divorced couples who
								answered the 54 questions based on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being strongly-disagree and 4 being
								strongly-agree. The Yontem study tested the accuracy of three machine learning methods -- Artificial
								Neural Networks (ANN), Radial-Basis Function Kernel (RFB) and Random Forest -- before and after feature
								selection. The ANN method combined with correlation based feature selection was identified to be the
								most accurate model to fit the data.</p>

							<p>In this project, we decided to do a similar analysis using different machine learning methods. In
								addition, our analysis included an expanded data set, augmented with responses from close family and
								friends. The survey instrument was created in Google Forms and can be found <a target="_blank"
									href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnvxPtGGtEI_Nb1UZRecZ6lBX7Z3pQL5zoWu8fyVhLIgug2A/viewform">here</a>.
							</p>
							<p>Our analysis was conducted using the following technologies: python, pandas: matplotlib, plotly,
								sklearn, seaborn, and numpy. </p>

									<p>For the original Turkish dataset, we chose to do Lasso and Ridge linear regressions to reduce model
										complexity. Ridge puts constraints on the coefficients which in effect, shrinks the coefficient.
										Lasso differs from Ridge in that it helps reduce over-fitting by taking into account magnitudes.
										Both regression methods find the first point where the elliptical hits the region of constraints.
										For more information on these analyses click here. When splitting our data into test and training
										sets, we got an R2 score of 92% indicating that our data is predictable and linear regression is a
										good fit. Both the Lasso and Ridge analyses yielded R2 scores above 80% and low mean squared error
										rates below 0.17 indicating our model explains a good amount of the variability around our means.
										These statistics suggest that we can produce predictions that are reasonably precise. Our lower MSE
										indicates we are close to finding the line of best fit for our model. It is no surprise that our R2
										value decreased once running the analysis on our dataset as opposed to the training set.</p>

									<p>For this next model, a Random Forest was utilized to determine feature importance. This type
										provides a strong modeling technique that is better than using a single decision tree. A con to a
										decision tree is overfitting which allows the model to learn from the “noise” in the training data
										which could ultimately have a negative impact on the model’s performance. Since the Random Forest
										model aggregates a multitude of decision trees, it limits overfitting as well as error due to bias
										which yielded more useful results. This analysis identified the feature importance (i.e., which of
										the 54 questions) carried the most weight in predicting outcomes (married or divorced). The six
										questions below were identified by the Random Forest model as top features in priority order. Our
										analysis identified a different set of priority features when compared to the top features
										identified in the Yontem study.</p>

									<p>Similar to the Yontem study, our team analyzed the accuracy of three machine learning models on the
										augmented data set. The models used were K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), LinearSVC, and SGDClassifier.

										Except for KNN, the models achieved better accuracy overall with the original data set. This

									<p>The worst performing model was the SGD Classifier with feature selection for both data sets. In all
